# Data Driven Turbulence Modeling
* Trained with measureable quantities (derived from velocity and pressure fields, e.g. sparse velocity, drag coefficient).
* Deep neural network representing a non-linear eddy viscosity model (NLEVM)
* End-to-end training using ensemble Kalman method or continuous adjoint method.
